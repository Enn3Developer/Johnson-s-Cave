# Johnson's Cave
This is a game when you're called Jason and you're exploring these caves full of misteries.
Your goal is to unveil everything that hids in the shadows and discover what happened to explorer Johnson (hence this name).

# How to install
Atm, there aren't many methods to do so, so simply download the latest Godot 3.2.X (where X is the greatest number you could find) and export the project for your version.

# How to contribute
Great! Fork the project, make changes and pull request it! It's that simple, isn't it?
Now, about the conventions and standards and everything you should use, just do whatever you want but stay as near as possible as what I've done.
If you want to make changes about story or mechanics or whatever, be sure to talk me about first on Discord (Enn3DevPlayer#4453).

# Discord server
I'm also running a Discord server where you can talk with other people about it!
